<p className='mt-[1rem]  w-[85vw] lg:w-[40vw] lg:ml-[-4rem] font-semibold'>Where are diamonds exported from?</p>
<p className='mt-[0.5rem] w-[85vw] lg:w-[40vw] lg:ml-[-4rem]'>Belgium and Israel have been diamond trading spots for centuries. The biggest 'producers of Diamonds' are Russia, Botswana, Canada, South Africa and Angola. Namibia, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Australia and Sierra Leone complete the top 10. The U.S. imports most of its diamonds (87% in 2013) from just three countries: Belgium, Israel, and India. These three countries are major hubs for polishing and refining diamonds. Even though they are major diamond refining hubs, Belgium and Israel don't mine diamonds.</p>
<p className='mt-[1rem]  w-[85vw] lg:w-[40vw] lg:ml-[-4rem] font-semibold'>How are diamonds bought and sold?</p>
<p className='mt-[0.5rem] w-[85vw] lg:w-[40vw] lg:ml-[-4rem]'>Loose diamonds are bought from wholesalers and various middlemen, before they are set in gorgeous jewellery pieces. These, in turn, are sold at retail level (online or through traditional brick-and-mortar stores) to the public and become symbols of love and commitment between two people.</p>
